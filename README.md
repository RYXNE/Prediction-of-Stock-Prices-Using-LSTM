# Prediction-of-Stock-Prices-Using-LSTM
This repository contains my project that was developed during my UnderGraduate. 

Developed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model to forecast stock prices of companies listed in the NIFTY50 using the concept of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Python (NumPy, Pandas, Keras) and compared it with the Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroscedastic (ARCH) statistical model.

●	StockPrice.xlsx - contains various data for the companies listed in the Indian Stock Market NIFTY50 between 2000 and 2020.

●	Stock Price Forecasting.ipynb   - contains the LSTM model, it has 1 LSTM layer that has 10 neurons which works with Linear Activation Function and 1 dense layer that has 1 neuron.

●	visualize.py  - custom created package that is used inside Stock Price Forecasting.ipynb to visualize the graphs of stocks when training, testing, predicting and forecasting the prices.

●	ARCh.ipynb  - contains the Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroscedastic (ARCH) statistical model that whose efficiency we are comparing to that of the LSTM model.
